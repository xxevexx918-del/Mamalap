    <!-- Text 'Mamalap' - Using a serif font approximation since SVG doesn't embed fonts easily without outlines. 
         Using standard serif font-family fallback which usually renders fairly well, or paths if I had them.
         For a robust web asset, text is often better if we can ensure the font 'Playfair Display' is loaded, 
         but inside an IMG tag it won't load external fonts. 
         I will use raw SVG paths for a cleaner look if I were generating it, but simple Text tag with system serif 
         is risky in img tags.
         Better approach: Use inline SVG in HTML to inherit the font 'Playfair Display' from CSS. -->
    
    <!-- However, the user asked for an "asset". 
         I will write this as a helper file, but I might INLINE it in the HTML for best font consistency 
         OR I will use the path-based approach if I could trace it. 
         Since I can't trace, I will use the text tag and user can replace it or better yet, 
         I will implement it as HTML/CSS structure first (Text + Pseudo element) to ensure exact font match with the site.
         
         Wait, "Replace the existing logo layout... match logo in reference".
         Reference has a specific "Smile". 
         I will implement the logo as a <div class="logo-wrapper"> with text and an SVG curve. -->
